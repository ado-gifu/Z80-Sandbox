Drop Marat Fayzullin's code in 'src_Z80' to compile.

    https://fms.komkon.org/EMUL8/

ALSO, remember to uncomment "#define LSB_FIRST" in Z80.h.

-----

To run, use the following scripts from the top directory:

 - run 'init.sh' to create the directories.
 - run 'build.sh' to actually build the code.
 - run 'start.sh' to start the emulator.
